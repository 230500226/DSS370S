Here are the plausible narrations for the 14 conceptual model pathways.

---

### **Pathway (a): Supervisor to Staff**
A **supervisor** accesses the system to list or view the details of a **staff** member they are directly responsible for.

---

### **Pathway (b): Staff Registers Client**
A **staff** member performs the transaction to create a new **client** record in the system, linking the new client to the staff member who registered them.

---

### **Pathway (c): Staff Finds Property Owner**
A **staff** member looks up a **property** they manage to find the contact details and other information about the **owner** of that property.

---

### **Pathway (d): Staff Manages Property**
A **staff** member accesses or updates the information for a **property for rent** that falls under their management portfolio (e.g., changing the description, rent amount, or status).

---

### **Pathway (e): Staff Checks Property Viewings**
A **staff** member checks the viewing history for a specific **property** to see which **clients** have expressed interest by viewing it.

---

### **Pathway (f): Staff Accesses Lease via Property**
A **staff** member retrieves the **lease** agreement associated with a specific **property** they manage, perhaps to check its terms or expiry date.

---

### **Pathway (g): Owner Finds Managing Staff**
A property **owner** queries the system to find the name and contact details of the **staff** member who is currently managing their **property**.

---

### **Pathway (h): Client Views Property**
A **client** views a **property**, and this transaction is recorded in the system, including the date of the viewing and any comments the client may have.

---

### **Pathway (i): Property's Viewing History**
The system is used to generate a list of all **clients** who have viewed a particular **property**, which helps the staff gauge interest.

---

### **Pathway (j): Client Accesses Lease**
A **client** (tenant) accesses their active **lease** agreement through the system to review its terms and conditions.

---

### **Pathway (k): Find Tenant for a Lease**
A user (e.g., an administrator) looks up a specific **lease** by its number to identify the **client** (tenant) who holds that lease.

---

### **Pathway (l): Find Lease for a Property**
A user retrieves the current or historical **lease** agreement(s) associated with a specific **property for rent**.

---

### **Pathway (m): Staff Manages Client Preferences**
A **staff** member accesses a **client's** record to either view or update the client's stated rental **preferences** (e.g., desired number of bedrooms, location, budget).

---

### **Implicit Pathway: Find Property for a Lease**
A user looks up a **lease** by its number to find out which specific **property** the lease applies to. (This represents the logical reverse pathway of `(l)`).
