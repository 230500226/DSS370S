# Database Analysis and the DreamHome Case Study

## Understanding When to Use Fact‑Finding Techniques

Effective database development relies on accurate and comprehensive fact collection. Fact-finding techniques are most critical during the early stages of the database development lifecycle, particularly:

- **Planning**: Determining project feasibility and scope.
- **System Definition**: Establishing system boundaries and user roles.
- **Requirements Analysis**: Gathering detailed user needs and system constraints.

Understanding when to employ these techniques helps ensure that the database system is built on a solid foundation of verified requirements and real-world processes.

## Types of Facts Collected and Documentation Produced

The fact-finding process involves gathering various types of information vital for database design, including:

- **Data Elements**: Specific pieces of data needed by the system.
- **System Constraints**: Business rules, regulations, and technical limitations.
- **User Views**: Different perspectives and requirements from various stakeholders.

The documentation produced from this process includes:

- **Users’ Requirements Specifications**: Detailed descriptions of what users need from the system.
- **Systems Specifications**: Technical outlines describing how the system will meet user requirements.

## Overview of Fact‑Finding Techniques

Several methods are used to collect facts for database analysis:

- **Examining Documentation**

  - Reviewing existing forms, reports, and records to understand current data flows and business processes.

- **Interviewing**

  - Conducting both unstructured and structured interviews with stakeholders to gather insights, clarify needs, and uncover hidden requirements.

- **Observing the Enterprise in Operation**

  - Directly observing day-to-day operations to validate facts and gain practical understanding of workflows.

- **Research**

  - Utilizing external resources such as trade journals, reference materials, and industry user groups to inform system design.

- **Questionnaires**
  - Designing and distributing surveys to efficiently gather information from a broad group of users, noting the strengths and limitations of this approach.

## Worked Example: DreamHome Case Study

The DreamHome case study provides a practical illustration of database analysis:

- **Company Overview**

  - DreamHome is a property rental company seeking to modernize its operations with a new database system.

- **Sample Forms**

  - Examples include staff registration, property registration, client registration, property listings, and lease forms. These illustrate the types of data currently collected and managed.

- **Stakeholder Interviews**

  - Interviews with various roles (Director, Manager, Supervisor, Assistant) are conducted to elicit detailed requirements and user perspectives.

- **Requirement Documentation**

  - Collected facts are used to formulate:
    - A mission statement for the new system.
    - Mission objectives outlining key goals.
    - System boundaries defining what the database will and will not cover.
    - Major user views identifying different ways stakeholders interact with the system.

- **Fact Mapping**
  - The gathered information is organized into formal documentation to support the next stages of database design.

## Review and Exercises

The chapter concludes with review questions and practical exercises designed to:

- Reinforce understanding of fact-finding techniques.
- Encourage hands-on application using real or case study scenarios like DreamHome.

## Summary

Chapter 11 provides a comprehensive guide to conducting database analysis using fact-finding techniques. It emphasizes the importance of collecting accurate requirements early in the development process and demonstrates these methods through the DreamHome case study. Proper fact-finding ensures that the foundational data and requirements are well-defined, supporting successful database design and implementation in later stages.
